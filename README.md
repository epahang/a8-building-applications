 1- Did you receive any help from others (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who.
> I recieved help from my TA Marcus. He helped me realize I was using renderPlot instead of renderPlotly in my server.R... making my graph not show up. 

2- Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?
> 3

3- On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this challenge?
> 4

4- Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?
> One problem that I encountered was that I did not notice the difference between renderPlot and renderPlotly in the server, making this homework take longer than it should have. To make the challenge better, I think it would be helpful if we had more practice using tab panels or navigation panels. I also found it hard to know how to make size vary better in my graph because originally I made size = Petal.Width, however, the plots were too big, covering other data. I had trouble making size vary in the Map Shootings assignment 6 too.
